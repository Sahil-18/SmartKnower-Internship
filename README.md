# SmartKnower-Internship
This is the minor project. This project is a part of SmartKnower Machine Learning Internship programme. 
The project is about KNearestNeighbour (KNN) Classifier. 
A dataset is processed using KNN Classifier. 
Model learned using training set and predicted output for test set, I got accuracy upto 97.37%. 
Conclusion of 'Confusion Matrix' is the model efficiently predicted all cases of Iris-Setosa, and Iris-virginica. But out of 15 cases, model correctly predicted 14 cases as 
Iris-versicolor and incorrectly predicted one output as Iris-virginica. 
This conclusions can also be made from 'Classification Report'.
